About 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Legends tell about 7 stones of power. If one were to obtain all 7, a great power
would be granted unto that being.

================================================================================ 
Compiling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Refer to the README.md found on the repository. 

================================================================================ 
Dependencies (linux) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

To run this game, you must have SDL2 installed on your system. 
Simply install it from apt-get and it should work: 

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0.0 

If that doesn't work, try using the development package: 

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev 

================================================================================ 
Installation 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

No extra steps are needed. Just be sure that the 'assets' directory is on the
same one where the application is.

================================================================================ 
Instructions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Gamepad is strongly advised!

Keyboard:
- Use 'A' and 'D' to move
- 'spacebar' jumps
- Aim and fire with the mouse

Gamepad:
- Use the left stick to move and the shoulder buttons to jump
- Aim with the right stick and shoot with the trigger buttons


*I only tested using a XBox 360 wired gamepad, so I can't assure that any other 
will work. If your gamepad isn't custom, it'll probably work fine. 
If the game finds a gamepad it doesn't support, it'll crash!!
